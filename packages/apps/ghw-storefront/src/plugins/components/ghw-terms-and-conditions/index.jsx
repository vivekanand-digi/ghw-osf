							relationship with GHW or this Agreement. This

							omission by GHW or any third party related to your
							use or attempted use of the products or services.
							You, GHW or any involved third party may pursue a
							Claim. GHW agrees to binding arbitration should it
							have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to
							binding arbitration should you have any Claims
							against GHW. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the
							right to go to court and agree instead to submit any
							Claims to binding arbitration. This includes Claims

							otherwise, as well as Claims regarding the scope and
							enforceability of this provision. It includes all
							Claims by or against you, GHW and/or any affiliated
							person, company and/or agent or representative. This
